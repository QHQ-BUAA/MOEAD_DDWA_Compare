Based on MATLAB, the evolutionary multi-objective optimization platform platEMO contains dozens of multi-objective optimization algorithms, and it is continuously updated. 
The algorithms under the Algs folder of this project are based on this platform and reproduced using Python. Interested researchers can visit the platEMO open-source link:
